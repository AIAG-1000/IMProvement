# IMProvement
Version control for IMProvement

This project is mainly to practice Python and things ancilliary to Python such as Github.

The following list is a non-exhaustive example of what I want to have a better understanding of:
- Writing functions
- Importing modules and using their documentation
- Using Git to maintain the project versions
- Using seperate files for storing data
- Calling functions from other files
